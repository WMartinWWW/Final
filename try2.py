    - Beer has a 26.6% market share, which is significant but less than liquor (37.1%) and wine (34.5%). This suggests a competitive marketplace with beer as a strong but not dominant player.
    - The other categories have much smaller shares, indicating that the sales focus primarily on alcoholic beverages, with additional revenue streams from related products and supplies.

    - **Cluster 2:** The lowest spending with a frequency akin to the others (average spend of 628, frequency also close to 5).
