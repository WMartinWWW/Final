    **Market Share Analysis Commentary:**

    - Beer has a 26.6% market share, which is significant but less than liquor (37.1%) and wine (34.5%). This suggests a competitive marketplace with beer as a strong but not dominant player.
    - The other categories have much smaller shares, indicating that the sales focus primarily on alcoholic beverages, with additional revenue streams from related products and supplies.

    - In contrast, the year variableâ€™s negative correlation with the month might indicate data spanning multiple years, where the month's impact on sales diminishes over time.
